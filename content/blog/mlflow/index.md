<p>At <a href = https://www.blablaconf.com> BlablaConf</a>, I had the privilege to give a <a href=https://youtu.be/rVLlGQcXgOQ?t=16393> talk </a> all about <a href = https://mlflow.org>MLflow</a>, a handy tool that helps make machine learning projects run smoother. I broke down how it keeps track of different experiments you do, how it bundles up your models neatly, and how it makes deploying them a breeze. I stressed how important it is for teams to work well together in data science, and MLflow makes that happen by keeping everything organized and reproducible. During the talk, I shared practical examples and demos to make it easier to understand how MLflow works.

The attached slides further elucidate key concepts and implementation strategies discussed during the session, providing a valuable resource for continued exploration and implementation of MLflow in real-world projects.
