During my phd years, I made a demo of indoor human activity recognition using FMCW radar and machine learning. The schematic below shows the end to end system from the sensor node to the cloud. I was involved in the different stages of this work from the sensor configuration and the signal processing to building a convolutional neural network for Doppler maps classification.

This schematic shows the workflow of the demo from the sensor edge to the cloud.

<h2>Technologies</h2>

The technologies that were used to make this demo are:
    <ul>
        <li>Os: Ubuntu, Raspbian</li>
        <li>C++: signal processing on the sensor's microcontrolller</li>
        <li>Python:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Tensorflow</b>: Training the model </li>
                <li><b>MLFlow</b>: Experiments tracking</li>
                <li><b>PyQT/PyQtgraph</b>: Graphical user interface and visualization</li>
                <li><b>Threading / Queue</b>: To manage threads execution</li>
                <li><b>Scikit-learn, Numpy ...</b> </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Docker: Utilized for developing the demo on a laptop and deploying it on a Raspberry Pi using a Python Docker image tailored for Raspberry Pi, streamlining deployment across other devices.</li>
    </ul>

This demo runs a convolutional neural network that was trained on a previously collected dataset in the same environment with different people. The following is the used architecture:

Finally, these videos were made to show the real time test of the demo.
