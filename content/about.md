## What I do

As a PhD researcher and a teaching assistant at KU Leuven, I am pursuing my passion for developing innovative solutions for gesture recognition using machine learning and signal processing. I have more than three years of experience in image and signal processing, having obtained my engineering degree from Universit√© de Rennes I and Mohammedia school of engineers, I worked as a junior researcher at InterDigital, Inc. There, I built algorithms to prepare, process, and classify radar data for interpreting human activities. I am driven by the mission of advancing the field of human activity recognition using machine learning. I value collaboration, creativity, and curiosity, and I strive to contribute to the academic and industrial communities with my research and teaching skills.
